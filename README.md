# React Portfolio

This is a portfolio listing six of my projects that I have completed over the course of the UT Coding Bootcamp. The application includes an About Me page, links to the six projects and their Github repos, a resume page with a downloadable resume, and a contact page to be filled out by the user.

The application includes a footer with links to my social media sites.

It was built with: React, Bootstrap, react-dom, react-router-dom, and built with Vite.
